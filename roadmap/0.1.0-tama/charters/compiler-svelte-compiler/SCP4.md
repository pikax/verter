# SCP4 — Svelte server Default compiler

Readiness comes only from trusted implementation-ledger rows. A READY node may start; tooling does not validate commit locators, Git identity, receipts, leases, external state, or runtime admission.

## Independently acceptable outcome

Svelte server Default compiler. The current owner is **Svelte runtime emitter and assembly paths**. The final and sole owner is **Svelte-owned Default compiler cells over shared compiler substrate**. This charter accepts one authority/migration/cutover boundary; it contains no independently dispatchable subblocks.

## Concrete surfaces and APIs

- Production surfaces: `crates/verter_compiler/src/framework/svelte`, `crates/verter_svelte_conformance`, `packages/svelte-runtime-tests`.
- Named API/data boundaries: `SvelteSemanticSnapshot`, `SvelteCompilePlan`, `SvelteTarget`, `SvelteArtifactSet`.
- Mutation boundary: only the production surfaces and named API/data boundaries above; every changed path must be inside both that charter surface and the acquired conflict domain, and sibling ownership is excluded.

## Exact predecessor contracts

- **SCP2:** implemented ledger row for “Compact Svelte compiler structure and canonical template topology”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **SST2:** implemented ledger row for “Svelte style-match facts and adaptive matcher cutover”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **External requirements:** agents check any listed requirement; tooling does not validate external state.

## Source-specific scope

- **Intent:** implement server compilation with shared semantics/structure/style and zero client-effect work.
- **Problem:** server compilation can inherit client data structures or repeat shared analysis.
- **Solution and architecture decisions:**
- monomorphic Svelte+server executor;

## Acceptance IDs and discriminating proof

Preflight evidence selection: preserve all four acceptance outcomes below, then select the smallest evidence set that actually discriminates the touched contract. Existing behavioral coverage, compiler/type/capability enforcement, static validation, canonical gates, bounded inspection, and benchmarks are valid when accompanied by a terse rationale.

- **SCP4-AC1 — sole-owner outcome:** the named final owner must be sole and every displaced route named below must be deleted or structurally rejected. Prefer existing type, capability, dependency, compiler, or static enforcement. Add a negative or mutation test only for a plausible critical fail-closed/correctness boundary or a reproduced defect that existing evidence does not discriminate.
- **SCP4-AC2 — positive contract:** the named API/data boundary must preserve exact identities, provenance, completeness, and deterministic ordering. Reuse existing coverage or extend/table-drive one test before creating a new test.
- **SCP4-AC3 — incremental equivalence:** when the changed scope owns or affects incremental, cache, cancellation, stale-publication, or partial-result authority, prove incremental equals fresh and degraded outcomes cannot warm. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale tied to the untouched authority.
- **SCP4-AC4 — bounded work:** when the changed scope owns or affects a hot path, prove no hidden duplicate parse, resolve, plan, emit, copy, allocation, or retained candidate using applicable existing counters, inspection, or benchmarks. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale; do not add counters or a soak by default.
- Every proposed new test must name a plausible regression or contract boundary not already discriminated; prose/format assertions are allowed only when those bytes are the public contract. Do not add implementation mirrors, duplicate permutations, or universal negative/mutation tests.
- Test homes: `crates/verter_svelte_conformance/tests`, `packages/svelte-runtime-tests/test`.

## Deletions and forbidden designs

- Delete or structurally reject: **legacy Svelte emitter route**.
- Delete or structurally reject: **per-target prerequisite duplication**.
- Never add a dual-running authority, compatibility fallback, string/regex semantic recovery, test-only production bypass, resource-capacity predecessor, sleep/poll readiness, or unqualified cache/public identity.
- Do not implement successors or silently enlarge this charter. Discovery of a second independently acceptable outcome requires an amendment and a new DAG node before mutation.

## Budgets and mandatory rescope

- Target ceiling: 800 production LOC, 8 production files, 2 related crates/packages.
- Mandatory rescope above 1,500 production LOC, 12 files, 3 unrelated crates/packages, or when public/wire, unsafe, concurrency, or lifetime work is combined with another major concern.
- Correctness budget: zero stale publication, silent fallback, wrong-complete result, map/provenance loss, or identity aliasing.
- Performance acceptance: use the exact applicable metric rows and methodology from performance-gates.toml, the applicable MEM0 budget, or the owning ratified product catalog, under contracts/resource-and-finalization.md (L2). Exact work invariants, latency/allocation/RSS limits under their owning methodology, and bounded new-capability budgets are distinct. New capabilities and deliberate pressure policies declare bounded new work and replacement SLOs before measurement. Missing required coverage needs an owning-contract amendment before measurement; no implicit 0.0% threshold or post-hoc rebaseline applies.

## Abort conditions

- Stop before mutation if current source disproves the named owner/API boundary, an ancestor lacks an implemented ledger row, or the complete diff will not fit one review context.
- Abort the candidate on unexplained output, source-map, diagnostic, cancellation, allocation, latency, or RSS divergence; do not convert it into residue locally.

## Targeted verification

1. `cargo nextest run -p verter_compiler -p verter_svelte_conformance`
2. Run every final command in the bound `targeted-domain` profile on the squashed review candidate; targeted success alone is iteration evidence, not acceptance.
3. Bind the preflight evidence selection and terse rationale in the review report. Behavioral code changes require TDD with a failing discriminating regression before production changes; do not invent a test or mutation solely to populate evidence.

## Review and lower-severity findings

Apply `semantic-3`: 2 fresh distinct harness tasks covering exactly `adversarial`, `conformance`. P0/P1 block final acceptance. A P2 follows the owning review policy and must have a named owner when deferred; otherwise it blocks. P3 follows the currently binding owning policy and must be recorded when that policy requires it. Any post-review content change invalidates every verdict. Final acceptance requires the complete 2/2 current-round profile to contain independent clean PASS reports on the squashed review candidate, plus `targeted` confirmation when required. A failed review/fix cycle is complete only after all assigned lenses and a FIX_REQUIRED disposition.

## Trusted implementation ledger

Before squashing or review, the implementation patch transitions this node's predeclared row in `authority/state/implemented.toml` from `status = "pending"` to `status = "implemented"` with the planned squash commit message, approximate date with timezone, and optional pull-request number. The transitioned row is the implementation fact. Commit metadata is a loose locator only and is never resolved or validated against Git or GitHub. Reviewers inspect the squashed candidate patch without SHA-, tree-, ancestry-, receipt-, lease-, or digest-bound orchestration manifests.

## Reconciled source-plan contract

**Intent:** implement server compilation with shared semantics/structure/style and zero client-effect work.

**Problem:** server compilation can inherit client data structures or repeat shared analysis.

**Solution and architecture decisions:**

- monomorphic Svelte+server executor;
- consume shared structure and style facts;
- segment-oriented server emission and minimal server plan;
- zero client effects, DOM plan, transitions/actions/hydration work;
- share prerequisites with client when both requested.

**Suggested predecessors:** `SCP2`, `SST2`.

**Normative source decomposition:** server text/escaping, elements/components/slots/blocks, style/head/module relations, maps, client+server sharing, performance proof.

**Acceptance:** server behavior/maps/CSS pass; client target counters are zero; combined client/server requests do not repeat parse/semantic/style/topology work.

**Forbidden:** client graph reuse by convenience, duplicate style matching, or full server target tree without evidence.

**Deletion/abort:** old server path deleted at `SCP6` after parity.
