# CLI5 — Base packaging, watch mode, compatibility wrappers, and promotion

Readiness comes only from trusted implementation-ledger rows. A READY node may start; tooling does not validate commit locators, Git identity, receipts, leases, external state, or runtime admission.

## Independently acceptable outcome

Base packaging, watch mode, compatibility wrappers, and promotion. The current owner is **separate package launchers and command-local project logic**. The final and sole owner is **one `verter` application service with thin command adapters**. This charter accepts one authority/migration/cutover boundary; it contains no independently dispatchable subblocks.

## Concrete surfaces and APIs

- Production surfaces: `packages/binary-launcher`, `packages/verter-lsp`, `packages/verter-tsc`, `crates/verter_mcp_server/src`.
- Named API/data boundaries: `ApplicationServices`, `SelectionPlan`, `Reporter`, `WriteTransaction`, `CommandCapability`.
- Mutation boundary: bounded validation, named residual deletion, and/or one atomic route switch only; no new authority may be introduced.

## Exact predecessor contracts

- **CLI2:** implemented ledger row for “Verter-native `typecheck` command”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **CLITS0:** implemented ledger row for “TypeScript-compatible `tsc` command”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **CLIC0:** implemented ledger row for “Registered carrier `compile` command”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **CLI4:** implemented ledger row for “`type-info`, `lsp`, and `mcp` command adapters”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **PER0:** implemented ledger row for “Cache/backend identity, cancellation, budgets, and zero work”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **External requirements:** agents check any listed requirement; tooling does not validate external state.

## Source-specific scope

- **Normative intent:** package and independently promote the base executable without waiting for formatter, lint, or future verticals.
- **Atomic boundary:** the production surfaces and named API/data boundaries above form this source-owned node's exclusive acceptance subset; this node owns its complete named migration population and exactly one deletion/cutover disposition.
- **Cutover evidence:** prove removal or structural rejection of **command-local semantic engine**, **non-atomic multi-file writes**, **ambiguous offset encoding** and satisfy the node-specific acceptance IDs below. A newly independent outcome requires an amendment and a new node before mutation.

## Acceptance IDs and discriminating proof

Preflight evidence selection: preserve all four acceptance outcomes below, then select the smallest evidence set that actually discriminates the touched contract. Existing behavioral coverage, compiler/type/capability enforcement, static validation, canonical gates, bounded inspection, and benchmarks are valid when accompanied by a terse rationale.

- **CLI5-AC1 — sole-owner outcome:** the named final owner must be sole and every displaced route named below must be deleted or structurally rejected. Prefer existing type, capability, dependency, compiler, or static enforcement. Add a negative or mutation test only for a plausible critical fail-closed/correctness boundary or a reproduced defect that existing evidence does not discriminate.
- **CLI5-AC2 — positive contract:** the named API/data boundary must preserve exact identities, provenance, completeness, and deterministic ordering. Reuse existing coverage or extend/table-drive one test before creating a new test.
- **CLI5-AC3 — incremental equivalence:** when the changed scope owns or affects incremental, cache, cancellation, stale-publication, or partial-result authority, prove incremental equals fresh and degraded outcomes cannot warm. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale tied to the untouched authority.
- **CLI5-AC4 — bounded work:** when the changed scope owns or affects a hot path, prove no hidden duplicate parse, resolve, plan, emit, copy, allocation, or retained candidate using applicable existing counters, inspection, or benchmarks. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale; do not add counters or a soak by default.
- Every proposed new test must name a plausible regression or contract boundary not already discriminated; prose/format assertions are allowed only when those bytes are the public contract. Do not add implementation mirrors, duplicate permutations, or universal negative/mutation tests.
- Test homes: `packages/binary-launcher/cli.spec.ts`, `crates/verter_mcp_server/tests`.

## Deletions and forbidden designs

- Delete or structurally reject: **command-local semantic engine**.
- Delete or structurally reject: **non-atomic multi-file writes**.
- Delete or structurally reject: **ambiguous offset encoding**.
- Never add a dual-running authority, compatibility fallback, string/regex semantic recovery, test-only production bypass, resource-capacity predecessor, sleep/poll readiness, or unqualified cache/public identity.
- Do not implement successors or silently enlarge this charter. Discovery of a second independently acceptable outcome requires an amendment and a new DAG node before mutation.

## Budgets and mandatory rescope

- Target ceiling: 300 production LOC, 3 production files, 1 related crates/packages.
- Mandatory rescope above 1,500 production LOC, 12 files, 3 unrelated crates/packages, or when public/wire, unsafe, concurrency, or lifetime work is combined with another major concern.
- Correctness budget: zero stale publication, silent fallback, wrong-complete result, map/provenance loss, or identity aliasing.
- Performance acceptance: use the exact applicable metric rows and methodology from performance-gates.toml, the applicable MEM0 budget, or the owning ratified product catalog, under contracts/resource-and-finalization.md (L2). Exact work invariants, latency/allocation/RSS limits under their owning methodology, and bounded new-capability budgets are distinct. New capabilities and deliberate pressure policies declare bounded new work and replacement SLOs before measurement. Missing required coverage needs an owning-contract amendment before measurement; no implicit 0.0% threshold or post-hoc rebaseline applies.

## Abort conditions

- Stop before mutation if current source disproves the named owner/API boundary, an ancestor lacks an implemented ledger row, or the complete diff will not fit one review context.
- Abort the candidate on unexplained output, source-map, diagnostic, cancellation, allocation, latency, or RSS divergence; do not convert it into residue locally.

## Targeted verification

1. `pnpm --filter @verter/binary-launcher test`
2. Run every final command in the bound `ts-domain` profile on the squashed review candidate; targeted success alone is iteration evidence, not acceptance.
3. Bind the preflight evidence selection and terse rationale in the review report. Behavioral code changes require TDD with a failing discriminating regression before production changes; do not invent a test or mutation solely to populate evidence.

## Review and lower-severity findings

Apply `architecture-3`: 3 fresh distinct harness tasks covering exactly `adversarial`, `conformance`, `architecture-specialist`. P0/P1 block final acceptance. A P2 follows the owning review policy and must have a named owner when deferred; otherwise it blocks. P3 follows the currently binding owning policy and must be recorded when that policy requires it. Any post-review content change invalidates every verdict. Final acceptance requires the complete 3/3 current-round profile to contain independent clean PASS reports on the squashed review candidate, plus `independent-full` confirmation when required. A failed review/fix cycle is complete only after all assigned lenses and a FIX_REQUIRED disposition.

## Trusted implementation ledger

Before squashing or review, the implementation patch transitions this node's predeclared row in `authority/state/implemented.toml` from `status = "pending"` to `status = "implemented"` with the planned squash commit message, approximate date with timezone, and optional pull-request number. The transitioned row is the implementation fact. Commit metadata is a loose locator only and is never resolved or validated against Git or GitHub. Reviewers inspect the squashed candidate patch without SHA-, tree-, ancestry-, receipt-, lease-, or digest-bound orchestration manifests.

## Reconciled source-plan contract

**Intent:** package and independently promote the base executable without waiting for formatter, lint, or future verticals.
**Predecessors:** `CLI2`, `CLITS0`, `CLIC0`, `CLI4`, `PER0`.
**Subblocks:** (1) native platform package matrix and integrity/provenance; (2) npm `@verter/cli` install/dispatch; (3) bounded watch/incremental session reuse; (4) convert named old binaries to thin wrappers over the same executable/service registry; (5) retain wrappers for one explicitly named published release with telemetry/deprecation receipt; (6) cold/warm/RSS/cancellation/signal/CI tests, generated command matrix, docs, and exact-candidate reviews.
**Acceptance:** clean installs work on every locked platform; commands advertise only available services; watch equals repeated fresh results and plateaus memory; wrappers execute the same implementation; base CLI promotes independently of fmt/lint/Astro/Qwik/project profiles.
**Forbidden:** downloading unverified binaries, separate alias implementations, hidden daemon state, or withholding CLI release for incomplete Astro/Qwik/project profiles.
**Deletion/abort:** do not delete compatibility wrappers here; a later charter may delete them only after the named published-release receipt and zero-consumer/generated-reference proof. A failing platform remains explicitly unsupported rather than receiving an unverified fallback.
