# HWC1 — Neutral HTML parser adoption and HWC carrier cutover

Readiness comes only from trusted implementation-ledger rows. A READY node may start; tooling does not validate commit locators, Git identity, receipts, leases, external state, or runtime admission.

## Independently acceptable outcome

Neutral HTML parser adoption and HWC carrier cutover. The current owner is **HTML tooling and custom-element consumers**. The final and sole owner is **neutral HTML/Web Components vertical on TypeInfo and workspace index**. This charter accepts one authority/migration/cutover boundary; it contains no independently dispatchable subblocks.

## Concrete surfaces and APIs

- Production surfaces: `crates/verter_language/src`, `crates/verter_session/src`, `crates/verter_lsp/src`, `crates/verter_protocol/src`.
- Named API/data boundaries: `HtmlFacts`, `CustomElementDeclaration`, `RegistryScope`, `CemModule`, `IndexContribution`.
- Mutation boundary: only the production surfaces and named API/data boundaries above; every changed path must be inside both that charter surface and the acquired conflict domain, and sibling ownership is excluded.

## Exact predecessor contracts

- **HWC0:** implemented ledger row for “HTML + standards Custom Elements implementation lock”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **PAR0:** implemented ledger row for “Parser decision, ownership, reuse, and lineage contract”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **ENC1:** implemented ledger row for “Tagged boundary conversion convergence”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **External requirements:** agents check any listed requirement; tooling does not validate external state.

## Source-specific scope

- **Normative intent:** create an owned HTML syntax frontend by copying/specializing the closest proven parser, not by building an omni parser.
- **Atomic boundary:** the production surfaces and named API/data boundaries above form this source-owned node's exclusive acceptance subset; this node owns its complete named migration population and exactly one deletion/cutover disposition.
- **Cutover evidence:** prove removal or structural rejection of **legacy shared custom-element registry**, **framework-local HTML fact authority** and satisfy the node-specific acceptance IDs below. A newly independent outcome requires an amendment and a new node before mutation.

## Acceptance IDs and discriminating proof

Preflight evidence selection: preserve all four acceptance outcomes below, then select the smallest evidence set that actually discriminates the touched contract. Existing behavioral coverage, compiler/type/capability enforcement, static validation, canonical gates, bounded inspection, and benchmarks are valid when accompanied by a terse rationale.

- **HWC1-AC1 — sole-owner outcome:** the named final owner must be sole and every displaced route named below must be deleted or structurally rejected. Prefer existing type, capability, dependency, compiler, or static enforcement. Add a negative or mutation test only for a plausible critical fail-closed/correctness boundary or a reproduced defect that existing evidence does not discriminate.
- **HWC1-AC2 — positive contract:** the named API/data boundary must preserve exact identities, provenance, completeness, and deterministic ordering. Reuse existing coverage or extend/table-drive one test before creating a new test.
- **HWC1-AC3 — incremental equivalence:** when the changed scope owns or affects incremental, cache, cancellation, stale-publication, or partial-result authority, prove incremental equals fresh and degraded outcomes cannot warm. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale tied to the untouched authority.
- **HWC1-AC4 — bounded work:** when the changed scope owns or affects a hot path, prove no hidden duplicate parse, resolve, plan, emit, copy, allocation, or retained candidate using applicable existing counters, inspection, or benchmarks. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale; do not add counters or a soak by default.
- Every proposed new test must name a plausible regression or contract boundary not already discriminated; prose/format assertions are allowed only when those bytes are the public contract. Do not add implementation mirrors, duplicate permutations, or universal negative/mutation tests.
- Test homes: `crates/verter_language/tests`, `crates/verter_lsp/tests`, `crates/verter_session/tests/cases`.

## Deletions and forbidden designs

- Delete or structurally reject: **legacy shared custom-element registry**.
- Delete or structurally reject: **framework-local HTML fact authority**.
- Never add a dual-running authority, compatibility fallback, string/regex semantic recovery, test-only production bypass, resource-capacity predecessor, sleep/poll readiness, or unqualified cache/public identity.
- Do not implement successors or silently enlarge this charter. Discovery of a second independently acceptable outcome requires an amendment and a new DAG node before mutation.

## Budgets and mandatory rescope

- Target ceiling: 800 production LOC, 8 production files, 2 related crates/packages.
- Mandatory rescope above 1,500 production LOC, 12 files, 3 unrelated crates/packages, or when public/wire, unsafe, concurrency, or lifetime work is combined with another major concern.
- Correctness budget: zero stale publication, silent fallback, wrong-complete result, map/provenance loss, or identity aliasing.
- Performance budget: when preflight identifies touched authority or a hot path, equivalent-work counters may increase by 0 and wall/allocation/RSS regression allowance remains 0.0% unless an owning-authority amendment supplies exact replacement thresholds. Otherwise performance evidence is not applicable; do not create counters or a 100-request retention soak solely to satisfy this charter.

## Abort conditions

- Stop before mutation if current source disproves the named owner/API boundary, an ancestor lacks an implemented ledger row, or the complete diff will not fit one review context.
- Abort the candidate on unexplained output, source-map, diagnostic, cancellation, allocation, latency, or RSS divergence; do not convert it into residue locally.

## Targeted verification

1. `cargo nextest run -p verter_language -p verter_lsp -p verter_session`
2. Run every final command in the bound `targeted-domain` profile on the squashed review candidate; targeted success alone is iteration evidence, not acceptance.
3. Bind the preflight evidence selection and terse rationale in the review report. Behavioral code changes require TDD with a failing discriminating regression before production changes; do not invent a test or mutation solely to populate evidence.

## Review and lower-severity findings

Apply `public-3`: 3 fresh distinct harness tasks covering exactly `adversarial`, `conformance`, `wire-public`. P0/P1 block final acceptance. A P2 follows the owning review policy and must have a named owner when deferred; otherwise it blocks. P3 follows the currently binding owning policy and must be recorded when that policy requires it. Any post-review content change invalidates every verdict. Final acceptance requires the complete 3/3 current-round profile to contain independent clean PASS reports on the squashed review candidate, plus `independent-full` confirmation when required. A failed review/fix cycle is complete only after all assigned lenses and a FIX_REQUIRED disposition.

## Trusted implementation ledger

Before squashing or review, the implementation patch adds one `[[implemented]]` row to `authority/state/implemented.toml` with the node ID, planned squash commit message, approximate date with timezone, and optional pull-request number. Row presence is the implementation fact. Commit metadata is a loose locator only and is never resolved or validated against Git or GitHub. Reviewers inspect the squashed candidate patch without SHA-, tree-, ancestry-, receipt-, lease-, or digest-bound orchestration manifests.

## Reconciled source-plan contract

**Intent:** create an owned HTML syntax frontend by copying/specializing the closest proven parser, not by building an omni parser.
**Predecessors:** `HWC0`, `PAR0`, `ENC1`.
**Subblocks:** (1) fork exact Vue parser lineage into the locked owner; (2) remove Vue directives/interpolation/component assumptions; (3) implement admitted HTML tokenization, tree facts, entities, namespaces, raw-text, comments, malformed recovery, and stable IDs; (4) add WPT/differential/fuzz corpus; (5) add incremental/full parity and budgets; (6) prove no dependency back to Vue.
**Acceptance:** pinned standards cells and malformed corpus pass; a source revision is parsed once; Unicode spans are exact; allocations/latency meet prelocked gates.
**Forbidden:** parameterizing the Vue parser with `is_vue`, sharing semantic AST types, broad unsupported recovery success, or importing framework semantics.
**Deletion/abort:** delete copied Vue-only paths and names; abort if independent ownership cannot be obtained without changing Vue behavior.

## Collapsed non-authoritative subblock disposition

The recovery candidate mechanically split this source-owned atomic node into the following labels: `HFP0`, `HFP1`, `HFP2`, `HFP3`. They have no separate dispatch, lease, receipt, migration manifest, deletion ownership, or review standing. Their useful source-described concerns are internal RED/GREEN checklist items of **HWC1**; HWC1 alone owns the complete migration population, exactly one final deletion/cutover, and atomic acceptance. Any quoted “suggested subblock” wording in transferred source text is non-authoritative planning context.
