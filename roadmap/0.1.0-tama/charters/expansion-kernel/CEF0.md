# CEF0 — Custom Element producer/consumer interoperability contract

Readiness comes only from trusted implementation-ledger rows. A READY node may start; tooling does not validate commit locators, Git identity, receipts, leases, external state, or runtime admission.

## Independently acceptable outcome

Custom Element producer/consumer interoperability contract. The current owner is **framework-shaped host/session registries and untagged public boundaries**. The final and sole owner is **typed immutable universal catalog and demand-selected kernel services**. This charter accepts one authority/migration/cutover boundary; it contains no independently dispatchable subblocks.

## Concrete surfaces and APIs

- Production surfaces: `crates/verter_language/src`, `crates/verter_session/src`, `crates/verter_protocol/src`, `crates/verter_identity/src`.
- Named API/data boundaries: `CarrierProfileId`, `FrameworkProfileId`, `ProjectProfileId`, `CatalogSnapshot`, `DemandPlan`, `TypeInfoRequest`.
- Mutation boundary: authority/evidence bytes only; production LOC is zero.

## Exact predecessor contracts

- **TIF1:** implemented ledger row for “TypeInfo-first ComponentInfo and component-meta cutover”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **IDX0:** implemented ledger row for “Atomic semantic contributions and workspace index”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **VID0:** implemented ledger row for “Orthogonal identities and exact-release law”; ledger presence alone satisfies the predecessor. Its commit message, approximate timezone-bearing date, and optional PR are locator hints only.
- **External requirements:** agents check any listed requirement; tooling does not validate external state.

## Source-specific scope

- **Normative intent:** define the standards-level interchange and CEM contract—without owning its implementation—while keeping producer and consumer evidence vertical-owned.
- **Atomic boundary:** the production surfaces and named API/data boundaries above form this source-owned node's exclusive acceptance subset; this node owns its complete named migration population and exactly one deletion/cutover disposition.
- **Inventory evidence:** classify every displaced authority and assign its implementation/cutover owner. This contract node proves inventory completeness and unambiguous ownership; later implementation nodes prove production deletion.

## Acceptance IDs and discriminating proof

Preflight evidence selection: preserve all four acceptance outcomes below, then select the smallest evidence set that actually discriminates the touched contract. Existing behavioral coverage, compiler/type/capability enforcement, static validation, canonical gates, bounded inspection, and benchmarks are valid when accompanied by a terse rationale.

- **CEF0-AC1 — ownership contract:** every inventoried outcome, consumer and displaced route has exactly one declared implementation/deletion owner. Validate contract artifacts and their negative controls; production deletion is acceptance of the later owner, not this documentation-only node.
- **CEF0-AC2 — positive contract:** the named API/data boundary must preserve exact identities, provenance, completeness, and deterministic ordering. Reuse existing coverage or extend/table-drive one test before creating a new test.
- **CEF0-AC3 — incremental equivalence:** when the changed scope owns or affects incremental, cache, cancellation, stale-publication, or partial-result authority, prove incremental equals fresh and degraded outcomes cannot warm. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale tied to the untouched authority.
- **CEF0-AC4 — bounded work:** when the changed scope owns or affects a hot path, prove no hidden duplicate parse, resolve, plan, emit, copy, allocation, or retained candidate using applicable existing counters, inspection, or benchmarks. Otherwise record a terse not-applicable rationale; do not add counters or a soak by default.
- Every proposed new test must name a plausible regression or contract boundary not already discriminated; prose/format assertions are allowed only when those bytes are the public contract. Do not add implementation mirrors, duplicate permutations, or universal negative/mutation tests.
- Test homes: `crates/verter_language/tests`, `crates/verter_session/tests/cases`, `crates/verter_protocol/tests`.

## Deletions and forbidden designs

- Inventory and assign the later deletion/rejection owner for: **central framework switch**. This node changes no production route.
- Inventory and assign the later deletion/rejection owner for: **untagged coordinate/public identity**. This node changes no production route.
- Inventory and assign the later deletion/rejection owner for: **duplicate component information authority**. This node changes no production route.
- Never add a dual-running authority, compatibility fallback, string/regex semantic recovery, test-only production bypass, resource-capacity predecessor, sleep/poll readiness, or unqualified cache/public identity.
- Do not implement successors or silently enlarge this charter. Discovery of a second independently acceptable outcome requires an amendment and a new DAG node before mutation.

## Budgets and mandatory rescope

- Target ceiling: 0 production LOC, 0 production files, 0 related crates/packages.
- Mandatory rescope above 1,500 production LOC, 12 files, 3 unrelated crates/packages, or when public/wire, unsafe, concurrency, or lifetime work is combined with another major concern.
- Correctness budget: zero stale publication, silent fallback, wrong-complete result, map/provenance loss, or identity aliasing.
- Performance acceptance: use the exact applicable metric rows and methodology from performance-gates.toml or the owning ratified product catalog, under contracts/resource-and-finalization.md (L2). Exact work invariants, statistical latency/RSS limits and bounded new-capability budgets are distinct. Missing required coverage needs an owning-contract amendment before measurement; no implicit 0.0% threshold or post-hoc rebaseline applies.

## Abort conditions

- Stop before mutation if current source disproves the named owner/API boundary, an ancestor lacks an implemented ledger row, or the complete diff will not fit one review context.
- Abort the candidate on unexplained output, source-map, diagnostic, cancellation, allocation, latency, or RSS divergence; do not convert it into residue locally.

## Targeted verification

1. `cargo nextest run -p verter_language -p verter_protocol -p verter_session`
2. Run every final command in the bound `docs-domain` profile on the squashed review candidate; targeted success alone is iteration evidence, not acceptance.
3. Bind the preflight evidence selection and terse rationale in the review report. Behavioral code changes require TDD with a failing discriminating regression before production changes; do not invent a test or mutation solely to populate evidence.

## Review and lower-severity findings

Apply `architecture-3`: 3 fresh distinct harness tasks covering exactly `adversarial`, `conformance`, `architecture-specialist`. P0/P1 block final acceptance. A P2 follows the owning review policy and must have a named owner when deferred; otherwise it blocks. P3 follows the currently binding owning policy and must be recorded when that policy requires it. Any post-review content change invalidates every verdict. Final acceptance requires the complete 3/3 current-round profile to contain independent clean PASS reports on the squashed review candidate, plus `independent-full` confirmation when required. A failed review/fix cycle is complete only after all assigned lenses and a FIX_REQUIRED disposition.

## Trusted implementation ledger

Before squashing or review, the implementation patch transitions this node's predeclared row in `authority/state/implemented.toml` from `status = "pending"` to `status = "implemented"` with the planned squash commit message, approximate date with timezone, and optional pull-request number. The transitioned row is the implementation fact. Commit metadata is a loose locator only and is never resolved or validated against Git or GitHub. Reviewers inspect the squashed candidate patch without SHA-, tree-, ancestry-, receipt-, lease-, or digest-bound orchestration manifests.

## Reconciled source-plan contract

**Intent:** define the standards-level interchange and CEM contract—without owning its implementation—while keeping producer and consumer evidence vertical-owned.
**Predecessors:** `TIF1`, `IDX0`, `VID0`.
**Subblocks:** (1) manifest-required producer/consumer dispositions; (2) declaration/registration/registry-scope identities; (3) standards surface references into TypeInfo; (4) package/source/config provenance and completeness; (5) CEM serialization contract; (6) cross-framework association/ambiguity fixtures.
**Acceptance:** vanilla, same-tag different-scope, declaration-without-registration, unknown registration, and framework-produced examples remain distinguishable; no result claims runtime reachability.
**Forbidden:** implementing projection/import/export here, Lit-shaped superclass, filename-only detection, one global registry assumption, framework behavior inside standards core, or CEM as internal authority.
**Deletion/abort:** replace consumer-only WCP assumptions in the old proposal; rescope when scoped registry reachability cannot be proven and return typed ambiguity.
